# 🛡️ AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An experimental **Machine Learning & AI based Intrusion Detection System** built for research and learning in cybersecurity.  
This project demonstrates how anomaly detection, traffic analysis, and attack pattern classification can be performed using **Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and networking libraries like Scapy/PyShark**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to:
- Simulate and analyze network traffic for **malicious vs. normal behavior**.
- Train **ML/DL models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Autoencoders, LSTMs) to detect anomalies.
- Build a **lightweight IDS dashboard** (using Flask/Streamlit) for real-time monitoring.
- Provide an **open learning resource** for students and researchers in cybersecurity.
